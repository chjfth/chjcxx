Files here are auto-generated by GMU makefile. You should NOT edit them by hand.
Files here have to be checked into SVN because only by putting them to a server,
source file fetching on the fly by Visual Studio source server can be accomplished.

If the files here are changed by GMU, please check them into svn.

Detail: mm_snprintfA.cpp and mm_snprintfW.cpp are just copies of mm_snprintf.cpp.
Library developer should edit mm_snprintf.cpp only.
