		Points to the MBCS string, whose length is determined by mbbytes.

	@param[in] mbbytes
		- If 0, ggt_mbs2wcs will return 0.
		- If positive, tells exactly how many bytes in pmb to convert. In this case, 
		  ggt_mbs2wcs will not append an extra NUL Char to result buffer.
		- If negative(e.g. -1), indicates pmb is an NUL terminated string, and ggt_mbs2wcs
		  converts the whole string, including the terminating NUL Char.

	@param[out] pwc
		Pointer to output Unicode string buffer.
		Can be NULL if wcbufchars is 0 or negative.

	@param[in] wcbufchars
		Tells the buffer size of pwc, in Unicode chars. 
		The output will never exceed this buffer limit but the MBCS string conversion 
		will still carry on in order to tell you how many Unicode chars are converted
		(as return value) on return.
			\n\n
		Let wcbufchars<=0 is a way to know the resulting chars without providing a
		real buffer.

	@param[out] pConMbBytes
		This tells you how many bytes from pmb are consumed(converted) on return.
			\n\n
		NOTE: This may be less than mbbytes or less than the NUL-terminating string length in bytes, 
		-- this can happen if an invalid byte sequence for the MBCS is encountered.
			\n
			Example: For a GBK(codepage 936) sequence "30 31 A4 20 ...", 0xA4 is the lead-byte
			for a GBK character, but 0x20 is an invalid trail-byte, so the byte starting
			from 0xA4 can not get converted, and (pmb + *pConMbBytes) will point to 0xA4.
			\n
		When such a converting error occurs, the conversion stops. User should check this output
		to know whether this happens. On getting such an error, user can try starting 
		ggt_mbs2wcs() with a new pmb skipping the problematic byte(i.e. let pmb points to 0x20 in the example).
			\n\n
		Can be NULL if not interested(not recommended).

	@return 
		Return how many Unicode characters are converted out -- assuming the output buffer
		is sufficient. 
			\n
		The return value cannot be negative.

	 Note: pmb and pwc must not overlap.

	 Special case: If mbbytes is given explicitly and the final byte of it does not
	 concludes an MBCS char(e.g. it is an MBCS lead byte), will ggt_mbs2wcs() peek the trail
	 byte(s) beyond mbbytes to output an converted Unicode char? The answer is no, it will
	 report *pConMbBytes less than mbbytes. To distinguish this special case with the real
	 trail byte missing case, user can check it with ggt_mb2wc() after ggt_mbs2wcs() returns.
	 ggt_mbs2wcs() will not do that check for you because ggt_mbs2wcs() don't have any idea 
	 whether the bytes beyond mbbytes is valid for the caller.
