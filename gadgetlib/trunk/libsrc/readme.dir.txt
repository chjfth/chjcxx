Place your library source, headers and makefiles here. 
Principle: You only need files within this dir to make libs built. So, if user only wants to
build the libs, he only needs to checkout this dir, instead of checking out the whole 
repository (i.e. no unnecessary `examples', `vc6_proj' etc).
