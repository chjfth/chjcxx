[2008-08-XX] Chj: Naming rule:
Names of functions, structs, constants in this gadgetlib should all start with ggt_ .

[2008-08-11] Chj:
The interfaces here should strive to be as independent as possible, e.g. use standard types
such as int, long, and a special one "__int64" etc. Don't define complex struct and try
not to draw in trivial headers for users.
